Hint functions: 
I implemented the random hint and specific hint functions by making an API call that would use 
the solution stored in the backend and either randomly or specifically return a correct cell’s value. 
For the specific cell, extra logic had to be added to update the state in the frontend with the row 
and column of the current cell being clicked on. I also had to make sure that this state update would 
happen after a single click by using React’s useEffect. I also updated the frontend by showing the hints in green.

Retrieve game:
I implemented the retrieve game feature by making an API call that would use a game ID to return 
the game stored in the database associated with that ID. The most complicated part was ensuring 
that the game would show correctly on the frontend side, which involved processing the game board 
and updating the state to reflect that.

Fixing bugs:
I fixed several bugs in the code, mostly in the check solution and note functionality. 

Successful game:
Our existing code did not trigger the dialogue box correctly when a game was successfully completed. I fixed the logic and also added a green glow around the game to more clearly visually indicate that the game was successfully completed.
